\section{Simulation Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Constant food and egg laying}
	\label{chap:constantFoodConstantLaying}
	The first iterative simulation run is based only on the equations of \textit{David S. Khoury et al.}\cite{khoury13}. As expected the hive stabilizes at an equilibrium point while the stored food increases infinitely (see graph \ref{chap:sim_R0_1} and chapter \ref{chap:constantFoodConstantLaying}).

\subsection{Constant food, dynamic egg laying}
	\label{chap:constantFoodDynamicLaying}
	The second iterative simulation run was to see if the new laying function (Figure \ref{fig:dynLayingRate})  was working as intended. As a result the bee population does not stabilize at one point, it now describes a more natural periodic form with a population maximum around August and a minimum around February.\\
	
	The colony we simulated did not survive with any daily mortality rates higher than 0.1. There are not enough bees emerging from eggs in order to compensate the mortality rate. However, we found that the new mortality rates assumed in our simulation (0.075 daily mortality) are still realistic. \textit{Henry et al.} \cite{henry12} describe mortality rates between 0.102 and 0.316 in empirical testing, which is the range in which \textit{Khoury et al.} \cite{khoury13} simulated. \textit{R. Dukas} \cite{dukas08} observed that mortality of foragers is in this range mainly because of predation. As we apply the mortality to all days, even in times and seasons without foraging (all bees stay in the hive), our simulated mortality rates are naturally lower.\\
	
	The stored food still increases infinitely, as the everyday income per forager bee is constant (see graph \ref{chap:sim_R0_2} and chapter \ref{chap:constantFoodDynamicLaying}).

\subsection{Environmental model}
	\label{chap:environmentalModelDiscussion}
	For testing the environmental model, we decided to change the quality indicator and delay seasons (especially autumn). The map (see chapter \ref{chap:mapFlowerPatchQuality}) is always a randomly generated map with equally distributed flower patches across the map and normal distributed flower patch quality. All other parameters are kept fixed so that the results are unambiguous.
	
\subsection{Empirical data based runs}
	In this run we wanted to see if our model can produce the same results as \textit{T.D. Seeley's} experiments from \textit{Wisdom of the hive} p. 44 fig. 2.14. Our date correlates quite well with the empirical data before swarming occurs, year 1982 compared to graph \ref{chap:sim_R1_1}. As swarming was never a part of our model were satisfied with the accuracy of our model. Furthermore, we could only compare the graphs as \textit{T.D. Seeley} did not publish the tabular form of his empirical data.\\
	Compared to our earlier simulations, the food collection rate is now dominated by the availability of flowers. The forager count is still a important factor as later simulations show.
	
	\subsubsection{Typical simulated day (environment interaction)}
		On a typical summer day, $80\%$ of the patches are discovered after 2.5 hours by the scout bees. The rate at which the food is collected is increasing throughout the day. The quite erratic changes in the first 4 hours we attribute to the discovery of new patches and the first path optimizations taking effect. The slope of stored food stabilizes as the path optimization has run it's course and no new food sources are discovered (see graph \ref{fig:day158}).\\
		
		For the statistical analysis of a typical summer day, we averaged the values and calculated the standard deviations for every parameter captured during an environment simulation (see graph \ref{fig:day158variation}). The 20 runs needed for chapter \ref{chap:variationsOnAutumnFlowers} were used as data basis. For spring and autumn, the plots would look approximately the same because an equal distributed flower map is used. This means the same optimizations and scouting behaviours are expected.\\
		High correlation can be found between the amount of discovered patches and the slope/change of food income (linear correlation coefficient of 0.9263). This is expected, because with a higher count of discovered patches, bees are able to figure out the best ones and increase their income.
		A little less correlated, but still significant is the amount of active foragers to food income (linear correlation coefficient of 0.8767). The least significant correlation is found between active scouts and food income (linear correlation coefficient of 0.5076). This makes sense as scouts are not collecting food, only discovering flower patches.\\
		In graph \ref{fig:day158variation}, the scout and forager count lowers a bit the middle of the day, between 10:30 and 16:30. The food income change directly reacts to this. This change in active bees exists because we selected the daily activity curve of the bees this way, according to \textit{T.D. Seeley's} empirical data (see \cite{seeley95}, p. 86, fig. 5.2.).\\
		
		The standard deviations are not significant for the discovered flower patches because with the high amount of scouts on this particular day (about 6\% of 20 000 bees), most of the introduced randomness is compensated (random walk, see chapter \ref{chap:randomWalk}).\\
		Active scouts and foragers vary a little, but mainly follow the activity curve we've chosen. The deviation is higher for scouts than for foragers because the amount of scouts is about 20 times smaller while the introduced variations happen in an absolute way (the balance between scouts and foragers can vary between two runs).\\
		Food income change has the highest deviation values because this is highly sensitive on how the bees select the waggle dances (see chapter \ref{chap:foragersDistribution}). However, over the day, the deviation gets smaller as bees always optimize towards the highest food income. This is also reflected in the total food collected over the day: At the beginning, we observe low deviations. The highest values are found on the middle of the day. At the end of the simulated day, the deviation is close to non-existent.

	\subsubsection{Missing flower seasons}
		\label{chap:missingFlowerSeasons}
		In our first set of simulations \ref{chap:sim_R1} we tested if any of the simulated blooming seasons is not essential to the hive. We also wanted to see the compensation mechanisms and how the basic model interacts with our environmental simulation. We found that the spring season falling out did not lead to a critical situation in terms of food. The peaks of the stored food in the summer were lower than those from the standard run \ref{chap:sim_R1_1}. This is because the bees are able to compensate the missing food income by consuming their stored food until summer.\\
		On the other hand if summer or autumn are missing the hive collapses. In the case of missing summer food income the bees will survive the summer but the hive population dwindles to a level of about 1000 bees (see graph \ref{chap:sim_R1_3}). This is not sufficient to collect enough food in the autumn season and the hive will die. Interesting events happen on day 200 after all stored food is eaten up: In order to survive, the bees stop taking care of the brood and eventually eat up the larvae (see equation \ref{eq:functionHiveBeesFood} in chapter \ref{chap:basicModel}). Because of the high need to get food, equation \ref{eq:changeForagers} of the basic model tries to recruit foragers from hive bees. From there on, both hive bee and forager numbers decrease as there is no brood to compensate mortality. On day 250, when the autumn season begins, not enough foragers are available and food, brood and bee numbers decrease monotonically.\\
		In case of a missing autumn food income, the hive will starve as the bees consume the whole stored food before the winter really kicks in. Again, the bees try to compensate by assigning more foragers, which doesn't help and would be contra productive in a real world scenario (higher mortality of foragers and energy loss due to pointless foraging).
		By cannibalizing their brood, bees can help themselves trough short term lack of food (slightly delayed seasons or bad weather) but not through a whole missing seasons.
		
	\subsubsection{Variations on autumn flowers}
		\label{chap:variationsOnAutumnFlowers}
		The idea behind variations on autumn flowers was to see at which point, of delay or quality reduction of the autumn season, the hive would start to collapse. For the quality indicator, we tested values between $M = 2.0\,\frac{kg}{day}$ and $M = 0.5\,\frac{kg}{day}$ (in steps of 0.5) for the autumn flowers (see fig. \ref{fig:seasonalFlowers} and chapter \ref{chap:flowerPatchesAndFood}). We delayed the season between 4 and 20 days (in steps of 4 days). More delay would shift the flowers into late autumn and winter, which makes no sense.\\
		We used 20 000 g and 1000 bees as the minimum needed in mid-winter in order to survive. We picked this values from observations made with the run in appendix \ref{chap:sim_R1}: About 20 000 g of food is consumed from January to May to stabilize the hive and start brood reproduction in order to be ready for the summer foraging (see graph \ref{chap:sim_R1_1}). With less than 1000 bees, the hive can't fire up reproduction fast and reliable enough (see parameters on how hive bees effect on brood survival used by \textit{Khoury et al.} \cite{khoury13}, p. 3).\\
		We found that shifting the season has no huge effect as forager counts do not vary that much in those 16 days difference. We assume that shifting the season back also decreases the blooming quality. Therefore, with $M = 0.5\,\frac{kg}{day}$ (see graphs \ref{chap:sim_R2_4_1} to \ref{chap:sim_R2_4_5}), the hive can not survive. The minimal stability point is around $M = 1\,\frac{kg}{day}$ (see graphs \ref{chap:sim_R2_3_1} to \ref{chap:sim_R2_3_5}). At this point, the variation of collected food over the year (see fig. \ref{fig:foodVariation}) becomes significant enough (3 to 5 kg) to affect the survival.\\
		
		Note that the standard deviation in Figure \ref{fig:foodVariation} basically sums up from the environment simulation (daily standard deviation of food income, see fig. \ref{fig:day158variation}). Therefore it only increases on foraging days, not during days without foraging, and does not decrease.

	\subsubsection{Model restrictions}
		Even though we extended \textit{Khoury's} model by environmental influences on flowers and food reward, it is far from complete. One big divergence from nature is the treatment of pollen and nectar as one. Pollen, which is the protein source, and nectar, which is the carbohydrate source, are actually collected by two different forager classes intra-colonially \cite{schmickl07}.\\  Another big factor of disturbance are diseases and infections and the possibility of swarming. Impairments in different aspects of a bee's life and behaviour, caused by pesticides or genetic mutation is entirely left out. There are also no other environmental influences such as aridity or wetland, human or invasive impacts of other species. \\
		Regarding the simulation of a bee's way of "thinking", we might never find a satisfying answer, it is only a model.
