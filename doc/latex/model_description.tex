\section{Description of the Model}
\subsection{Basic model: Hive simulation}
	Our model is widely based on the studies and equations of \textit{Khoury et al.} \cite{khoury13}. We used his quantitative models as described bellow and added new parameters to find out more about the bee's behaviour.\\
	Food, seasons, brood, foragers and hive bees are the cornerstone of our model. The dynamics of the hive is based on the bee's behaviour and their interaction with the environment as well as natural influences, i.e. seasons (which are separately added to Khoury's model). Food here means nectar and pollen, which is not further distinguished for simplicity reasons. After the queen laid an egg, a larvae develops inside a honeycomb cell. The equations show the proportionality of the pupation to the food income. Neglecting the complex process of reaching adulthood, we assume that larvae become adult hive bees 12 days after pupation. The mortality rate of hive bees or capped brood is negligible if there are not specific diseases implemented. $TODO$ The agents are only female bees since they are responsible for the foraging process and the maintenance and sustainability of the population. With all these information we can set up
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:changeBroodNumbers}
		{dB \over dt} = LS(H,f)-\phi B
	\end{equation}
	
	representing the rate of change of brood numbers. $L$ is  rate of the bee queen and $S(H,f)$ is a function of the survival rate dependent on the amount of food and  the number of hive bees. $\phi$ is the adult bee emerging factor and $B$ represents the uncapped brood. The equation gives us the survival rate of the brood. $S(H,f)$ is modelled as following:
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:functionHiveBeesFood}
		S(H,f)={f^2 \over f^2+b^2}{H \over H+v}
	\end{equation}
	
	The variable $v$ indicates the effect of the hive bees on the brood, whereas $b$ shows the food effect on brood survival. It decreases as food increases. As $f$ and $H$ become very large, $S(H,f)$ becomes constant. The food and hive bee number is no longer connected to each other. The first factor is a sigmoid function and shows the correlation of the food available and the capped brood. A decrease in brood can occur because of lack of food (they cannot be fed) and because adult bees consume the larvae to keep the resources in the hive and recycle the proteins (cannibalism). The second factor models the interdependency of the hive bee numbers on the survival of the brood. If there are large stores of food but no hive bees that can provide the food to the larvae, the brood survival also declines.  
	\\
	The second differential equation describes the rate at which the number of hive bees changes.	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:changeHiveBees}
		{dH \over dt}=\phi B(t-\tau)-HR(H,F,f)
	\end{equation}
	
	$\tau$ is the ageing time and $\phi B(t-\tau)$ is the rate at which adult bees hatch out from pupation. The second term is the recruitment function and given as
		
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:recruitmentFunction}
			R(H,F,f) = \alpha_{min} + \alpha_{max}({b^2 \over b^2+f^2})-\sigma({F \over F+H})
		\end{equation}
		
	This equation models the change from a hive bee to a forager bee. $\alpha_{min}$ denotes the transition when there is enough food but not much foragers. Conversely, $\alpha_{max}$ is used for less food. As before, $b$ is the food effect on brood survival and $f$ is the amount of food. $\sigma$ is the strength of social inhibition and is dependent on the number of foragers and hive bees.\\
	The third differential equation describes correspondingly the rate at which the number of foragers changes:
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:changeForagers}
		{dF \over dt} = HR(H,F,f)-m F
	\end{equation}
	
	The mortality rate $mF$ indicated the rate at which the foragers $F$ die. The recruitment function is the same as above.\\	
	The last equation outlines with the rate of food change in the hive's stores. Forager bees and hive bees are treated equally because their consumption is almost the same. 
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:changeFoodStoreConst}
		{df \over dt} = c F - \gamma_A (F+H) - \gamma_B B
	\end{equation}
         
	where $c$ describes the average food a single forager collects per day. In our extended model, we also implemented a season dependent factor with the result that c changes over time (see subsection~\ref{subsec:advancedModel} on page~\pageref{subsec:advancedModel}.). $\gamma$ is the consumption of adult bees ($A$) and brood ($B$).

	\subsection{Changing laying rate over seasons}

		\end{figure}
		
		%TODO: Description of what changed here!
		
		To make the model more realistic, equation \ref{eq:changeBroodNumbers} is replaced by equation \ref{eq:changeBroodNumbersTime}. This incorporates that the bee queen does not have a constant laying rate. Instead, interpolated values based on \textit{Wisdom of the Hive}, pp. 34 \cite{seeley95} are used for the laying rate $L(t)$ (Figure \ref{fig:dynLayingRate}). \textit{T.D. Seeley} denotes that the queen starts reproducing by early spring. We assumed that reproduction between April/May and October is realistic, as we obtained similar numbers of bees in summer (maxima) and winter (minima) to the empirical data of \textit{T.D. Seeley} \cite{seeley95}. The minimal laying rate of 200 eggs per day is used to compensate mortality during winter. The peak of the laying rate (2000 eggs per day) is the same as used by \textit{Khoury et al.} \cite{khoury13} and \textit{Wright} \cite{wright08}. The results are discussed in chapters \ref{chap:constantFoodConstantLaying} and \ref{chap:constantFoodDynamicLaying} with the corresponding plots in appendix \ref{chap:sim_R0_1} and \ref{chap:sim_R0_2}.
		
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:changeBroodNumbersTime}
			{dB \over dt} = L(t)S(H,f)-\phi B
		\end{equation}
		
		The introduction of dynamic laying rates led to problems with the mortality rates tested by \textit{Khoury et al.} \cite{khoury13}. The colony we simulated did not survive with any daily mortality rates higher than 0.1 (10\%). There are not enough bees emerging from eggs in order to compensate the mortality rate. However, we found that the new mortality rates assumed in our simulation (0.075 or 7.5\% daily mortality) are still realistic. \textit{Henry et al.} \cite{henry12} describe mortality rates between 0.102 and 0.316 in empirical testing, which is the range in which \textit{Khoury et al.} \cite{khoury13} simulated. \textit{R. Dukas} \cite{dukas08} observed that mortality of foragers is in this range mainly because of predation. As we apply the mortality to all days, even in times and seasons without foraging (all bees stay in the hive), our simulated mortality rates are naturally lower.
