\section{Description of the Model}
\subsection{Basic model: Hive simulation}
	Our model is widely based on the studies and equations of \textit{Khoury et al.} \cite{khoury13}. Food, seasons, brood, foragers and hive bees are the cornerstone of our model. The dynamics of the hive is based on the bee's behaviour and their interaction with the environment as well as natural influences, i.e. seasons (which are separately added to Khoury's model). Food here means nectar and pollen, which is not further distinguished for simplicity reasons. After the queen laid an egg, a larvae develops inside a honeycomb cell. The equations show the proportionality of the pupation to the food income. Neglecting the complex process of reaching adulthood, we assume that larvae become adult hive bees 12 days after pupation. The mortality rate of hive bees or capped brood is negligible if there are not specific diseases implemented. $TODO$ The agents are only female bees since they are responsible for the foraging process and the maintenance and sustainability of the population. With all these information we can set up
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:changeBroodNumbers}
		{dB \over dt} = LS(H,f)-\phi B
	\end{equation}
	
	representing the rate of change of brood numbers. $L$ is the laying rate of the bee queen and $S(H,f)$ is a function of the survival rate dependent on the amount of food and  the number of hive bees. $\phi$ is the adult bee emerging factor and $B$ represents the uncapped brood. The equation gives us the survival rate of the brood. $S(H,f)$ is modelled as following:
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:functionHiveBeesFood}
		S(H,f)={f^2 \over f^2+b^2}{H \over H+v}
	\end{equation}
	
	$v$ indicated the effect of the hive bees on the brood, whereas $b$ shows the food effect on brood survival. It decreases as food increases. As $f$ and $H$ become very large, $S(H,f)$ becomes constant. The food and hive bee number is no longer connected to each other. The first factor is a sigmoid function and shows the correlation of the food available and the capped brood. A decrease in brood can occur because of a lack of food, they cannot be fed, and because adult bees consume the larvae to keep the resources in the hive and recycle the proteins. The second factor models the interdependency of the hive bee numbers on the survival of the brood. If there are large stores of food but no hive bees that can provide the food to the larvae, the brood survival declines.  
	\\
	The second differential equation describes the rate of change of hive bees:
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:changeHiveBees}
		{dH \over dt}=\phi B(t-\tau)-HR(H,F,f)
	\end{equation}
	
	$\tau$ is the ageing time and the whole product $\phi B(t-\tau)$ is the rate at which adult bees hatch out from pupation. The second term is explained below.\\ 
	The third differential equation describes the rate of change of foragers
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:changeForagers}
		{dF \over dt} = HR(H,F,f)-m F
	\end{equation}
	
	with the recruitment function
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:recruitmentFunction}
		R(H,F,f) = \alpha_{min} + \alpha_{max}({b^2 \over b^2+f^2})-\sigma({F \over F+H})
	\end{equation}
	
	and the mortality rate $mF$. The recruitment function models the change from a hive bee to a forager bee. $\alpha_{min}$ denotes the transition when there is enough food but not much foragers. The rate is increased with less food described with $\alpha_{max}$. As before, $b$ is the food effect on brood survival and $f$ is the amount of food. $\sigma$ is the strength of social inhibition and is dependent on the number of foragers and hive bees.\\
	Rate of change in food stores:
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:changeFoodStoreConst}
		{df \over dt} = c F - \gamma_A (F+H) - \gamma_B B
	\end{equation}
	
	
	
	%TODO This is actually wrong, we did not change c in our (basic) model... have a look at the code. In the advanced model, we replace the term c * F with the result from the actual environment simulation! Please correct.
	where $c$ describes the average food a single forager collects per day. In contrast to Khoury, we implemented also a seasonal dependent factor, so c changes with rate X over time. $\gamma$ is the consumption of adult bees ($A$) and brood ($B$). It is not differentiated between foragers and hive bees.

		To make the model a bit more realistic, equation \ref{eq:changeBroodNumbers} is replaced by equation \ref{eq:changeBroodNumbersTime}. This incorporates that the bee queen does not have a constant laying rate. Instead, interpolated values based on \textit{Wisdom of the Hive}, pp. 34 \cite{seeley95} are used for the laying rate $L(t)$ (Figure \ref{fig:dynLayingRate}). \textit{T.D. Seeley} denotes that the queen starts reproducing by early spring. We assumed that reproduction between April/May and October is realistic, as we obtained similar numbers of bees in summer (maxima) and winter (minima) to the empirical data of \textit{T.D. Seeley} \cite{seeley95}. The minimal laying rate of 200 eggs per day is used to compensate mortality during winter. The top end of the laying rate (2000 eggs per day) is the same as used by \textit{Khoury et al.} \cite{khoury13}. The results are discussed in chapters \ref{chap:constantFoodConstantLaying} and \ref{chap:constantFoodDynamicLaying} with the correspondig plots in appendix \ref{chap:sim_R0_1} and \ref{chap:sim_R0_2}.
		
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:changeBroodNumbersTime}
			{dB \over dt} = L(t)S(H,f)-\phi B
		\end{equation}
		
		The introduction of dynamic laying rates led to problems with the mortality rates tested by \textit{Khoury et al.} \cite{khoury13}. The colony simulated by us did not survive with any daily mortality rates higher than 0.1 (10\%). This side effect occurs because not enough new bees emerge from eggs in order to compensate mortality. However, we found that the new mortality rates assumed in our simulation (0.075 or 7.5\% daily mortality) are still realistic. \textit{Henry et al.} \cite{henry12} denote mortality rates between 0.102 and 0.316 in empirical testing, which is the range in which \textit{Khoury et al.} \cite{khoury13} simulated. \textit{R. Dukas} \cite{dukas08} observed that mortality of foragers is in this range mainly because of predation. As we apply the mortality to all days, even in times and seasons without foraging (all bees stay in the hive), our simulated mortality rates are naturally lower.
