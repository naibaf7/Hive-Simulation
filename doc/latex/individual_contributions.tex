\section{Individual contributions}
	We discussed and extended the model together on a weekly basis, collecting and mixing individual ideas. The report was written in a cooperative manner. Every team member wrote the sections according to their \textit{individual tasks} and then corrected and extended the sections of the other two members. The individual tasks have been assigned by taking into account the programming skills, personal interests and available time.\\
	
	\textbf{Individual tasks:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Stefan Gugler, BSc Interdisciplinary Sciences:} Interpretation and application of empirical data in the basic and advanced model. Searching references and data in the literature.
		\item \textit{Elias Huwyler, BSc Computer Science:} MATLAB scripts for map generation, map loading and data plotting. Interpretation and analysis of the simulation results.
		\item \textit{Fabian Tschopp, BSc Computer Science:} Implementation of the basic and advanced model in MATLAB (object oriented structure, code hierarchy, actual implementation).
	\end{itemize}
