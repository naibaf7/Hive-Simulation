\section{Summary and Outlook}
\subsection{Realistic flowers and maps}
	To further increase the accuracy of our model, the flower blooming functions could be split up finer and replaced by more accurate ones than those we used. Our map was a computer generated map with equal distributed flower patches, an interesting idea would be to create maps of real places (agricultural, urban and near cities, near heavily used roads) and compare their results.
\subsection{Improvements to the hive model}
	The model would actually support multiple hives with different parameters. For example different bee species could be simulated on the same map contesting for food. \\Furthermore we never tried to implement swarming in our model, but by implementing swarming, and the models already existing capabilities to handle multiple hives, an evolutionary simulation over a long time span could lead to interesting results.\\Some of our measurements to reduce run-time (clustering, bigger time steps) could be reversed to increase the model's accuracy (runtime can go up to 10 hours for a simulated year with the most precise settings (as of 2013)).
\subsection{Summary}
	Overall we found that bees can compensate short term food problems quite well, by sacrificing larvae and recruiting bees for the most important tasks. Missing whole seasons or having the whole season under perform on the other hand is beyond their capability to adapt.
