\section{Summary and Outlook}
\subsection{Realistic flowers and maps}
To further increase the accuracy of our model, the flower blooming functions could be split up finer and replaced by more accurate ones as the ones we used. Our map we used was a computer generated map with normal distributed flower patches, an interesting idea would be to create amps of real places and compare their results.
\subsection{Improvements to the hive model}
The model would actually support multiple hives with different parameters. For example different bee species could be simulated on the same map contesting for food. \\Furthermore we never tried to implement swarming in our model, but by implementing swarming and the models capabilities to handle multiple hives a evolutionary simulation over a long time span could lead to interesting results.\\Some of our measures to reduce run-time could be reversed to increase the model accuracy(be warned runtimes can become up to 10h for a year).
\subsection{Summary}
Overall we found that bees can compensate short term food problems quite well, missing whole seasons or having the whole season under perform on the other hand is beyond their capability to adapt.
